Hi there !

To install the PHP scripts of the Share library :

	1.Database :
		- Open your favourite SQL manger (phpMyAdmin, SQLiteManager …)
		- Go into your favourite database or create one
		- Open the file php/install.sql inside the library's folder
		- Copy the content of install.sql and paste it in the SQL field allowing you to run requests (in your SQL manager)
		- Run the request
		- Two tables should appear in the table list : likes(ip, id, mark) and talks(id, talk_id, message)
	2. PHP
		- Connect to your web server with FTP or SFTP (using Filezilla or other…)
		- Copy the files in the php folder of the library's folder (except install.sql)
		- Paste them on your web server, in the folder you want
	3. Processing
		- Use new Talk() and new Like() with your web server URL follow by the folder you put the PHP inside

And it'll work.
