* The main function is the noise() function, which is used to 
* collect a set of values depending on the position in space or 
* plane. It takes an instance of the CellDataStruct class as its
* only argument. (See below for more info on CellDataStruct)
* The second public function is the constructor, which is used 
* to initialize the noise. It takes an instance of PApplet as
* its only argument.

* One instance of the data structure is needed to send data to 
* and from the noise() function. It is through this class the 
* cell noise is controled.
* The user will use the only available function (the constructor)
* to set the properties of the noise. The properties are listed 
* below, as the are expected by the function CellDataStruct():
* - controler applet (PApplet parent).
* - order of feature points to measure distances to (int max_order).
* - position in space or plane (int[] at)
* - type of distance measure (int dist_type)
*   [EUCLIDEAN | CITYBLOCK | MANHATTAN | QUADRATIC]
*
* After calling the noise() function with a specific CellDataStruct,
* this instance contains the information connected to the position
* defined in this instance before the function call. The available 
* return data is listed below:
* - F[0 .. max_order] is the distance to the closest feature points, 
*   calculated using the distance measure specified.
* - ID[0 .. max_order] is a unique ID number for each feature point.
* - delta[0 .. max_order][0 .. dimensions] is an array of the vectors
*   pointing from the sample position towards each of the first 
*   feature points.
